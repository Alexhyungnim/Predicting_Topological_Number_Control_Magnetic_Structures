Predicting Topological Numbers and Controlling Magnetic Structure Characteristics Using Machine Learning Techniques

Our study investigates the topological properties of input data using a single image as a training set, applying neural networks for analysis. 
The model generates a spin configuration from a topological structure image and predicts its topological number by integrating the solid angles formed by adjacent spin vectors.
